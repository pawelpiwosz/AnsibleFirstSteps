## Ansible first steps

This is "life" based tutorial, how to start with Ansible.  
I assume, you have some knowledge about Virtualenv and Vagrant,
if not, don't worry, all needed examples are explained.

The tutorial is organized in chapters. The point is, that each chapter has some
new stuff, and all of them need to be "rewritten" to your project.

As the prerequisities, you need to have:
* virtualbox
* vagrant (2.1 or newer)
* ansible (2.8 or newer)

Vagrant is using Ubuntu18 (bionic64) in this tutorial. Important is, that this
version has no Python installed. You need to do it by yourself.
