## Ansible first steps

This is "life" based tutorial, how to start with Ansible.  
I assume, you have some knowledge about Virtualenv and Vagrant,
if not, don't worry, all needed examples are explained.

The tutorial is organized in chapters. The point is, that each chapter has some
new stuff, and all of them need to be "rewrite" to your project.

Chapter 1 [Environment preparation](Chapter-01/README.md)  
Chapter 2 [Run ansible in Vagrant box](Chapter-02/README.md)
